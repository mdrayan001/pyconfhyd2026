## What is PyConf Hyderabad?

PyConf Hyderabad is the premier regional gathering for the Python community, bringing together those who use and develop the open-source Python programming language. Organized by the [Hyderabad Python User Group (HydPy)](https://www.hydpy.org/), this conference fosters knowledge sharing, collaboration, and the exchange of ideas, strengthening connections between developers and users through meaningful interactions.

Since its inception in [2017](https://pyconf.hydpy.org/2017/), PyConf Hyderabad has grown steadily, with successful editions in [2019](https://pyconf.hydpy.org/2019/), [2020](https://pyconf.hydpy.org/2020/), [2022](https://pyconf.hydpy.org/2022/) and [2025](https://2025.pyconfhyd.org/). Building on this rich legacy, we are excited to present the 6th edition of PyConf Hyderabad this year.

PyConf Hyderabad 2026 will have 2 major events: Conference, and Workshops.

- **Workshops** will be held on 14 March, 2026. On the workshop day, people can attend hands-on workshops, and learn about a topic from an expert.
- **Conference** will be held on 15 March, 2026. On the conference days, people connect with each other, discuss their experiences and present their ideas.

Event Features:

- A **Talk** is where people do a 25 min talk, on a topic. These talks are selected through a CFP process, before the event.
- A **Lightning talk** is a rapid 5 min presentation that is presented to the entire conference crowd, a great way to get a message across to the entire audience.
- **Sponsor Stalls** are where you can meet companies supporting the conference. These companies use Python and are looking for Python developers. You can visit their stalls to get to know more about them, and the openings in their organization.
