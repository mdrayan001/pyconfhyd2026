## Local Development / Setup Instructions

### Install Node.js and Package Manager

Before you start, ensure you have Node.js and a package manager installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. **Download Node.js**:
   - Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Download the v20.18.0 version. This was the latest LTS version when the project was created.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to check if Node.js is installed:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - You should see the version number of Node.js.

3. **Install a Package Manager**:
   - Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager) by default. To check if npm is installed, run:
     ```bash
     npm -v
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can use other package managers like Yarn or pnpm.

4. **Run the Development Server**:
   - Once Node.js and a package manager are installed, you can start the development server:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     # or
     yarn dev
     # or
     pnpm dev
     ```

   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the PyConf Hyderabad 2026 website! This document will guide you on how to contribute effectively and collaboratively to ensure a smooth development process.

### Introduction

This project is a fork of [pyconfhyd2025](https://github.com/HydPy/pyconfhyd2025), initially developed as a **modular conference website** featuring reusable components. To learn more, refer to the [introduction section of pyconfhyd2025](https://github.com/HydPy/pyconfhyd2025?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction).

A feature flag configuration has been introduced, enabling a gradual rollout of features. Check out the [PyConf 2026 setup PR](https://github.com/HydPy/pyconfhyd2026/pull/1) to see how changes can be made when setting up the conference website.

This year's focus is on improving the template while seamlessly integrating it with [HydPy's website](https://www.hydpy.org/) by redirecting selected pages to the main site.
